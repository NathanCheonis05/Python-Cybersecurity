    "# First Anomaly Detection Program\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to be my first program in Python that is dedicated towards anomaly detection and how it works. I will be testing out a variety of algorithms using the `pyod` library that has multiple algorithms dedicated for anomaly detection, outlier detection, and novelty detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be working with the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `PyOD`\n",
    " - `Pandas`\n",
    " - `Scikit-Learn`\n",
    " - `Matplotlib`\n",
    " - `Plotly`\n",

    " I will now start by importing the libraries.\n",
